; • Bartender replaces vehicles that don't exist in VltEd with "copheli".
; • Bartender replaces vehicles that aren't helicopters with "copheli".
; • Each value must be a string (i.e. plain text).
; • You can define a "default" value.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}SpawnDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = {min, max}SpawnDelay (RACES)
;
; • First spawns only happen at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • Each first-spawn timer is a random value between "minSpawnDelay" and "maxSpawnDelay".
; • Respawning uses separate delay values depending on the despawn context (see groups below).
; • The helicopter only ever spawns in player pursuits.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}RespawnDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = {min, max}RespawnDelay (RACES)
;
; • This respawn only happens at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • Each respawn timer is a random value between "minRespawnDelay" and "maxRespawnDelay".
; • A first spawn (see "[Helicopter:FirstSpawn]" above) is required to enable respawns.
; • It doesn't matter whether the first spawn happens at the same Heat level.
; • The helicopter only ever respawns in player pursuits.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

[Helicopter:LostRejoin]
; Delay interval and minimum fuel time (in seconds) for the helicopter to rejoin if it loses you.

; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}RejoinDelay, minRejoinFuelTime (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = {min, max}RejoinDelay, minRejoinFuelTime (RACES)
;
; • Rejoining only happens at Heat levels for which you define valid delay and fuel values.
; • Each rejoin timer is a random value between "minRejoinDelay" and "maxRejoinDelay".
; • The helicopter rejoins with whatever amount of fuel it had left, minus the rejoin timer.
; • The helicopter rejoins as the same vehicle and doesn't increment the helicopter counter.
; • Attempting to rejoin with less than the minimum fuel time triggers a "fuel" respawn instead.
; • If rejoining is completely disabled, losing you always triggers a "fuel" respawn instead.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value tuple.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}FuelTime (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = {min, max}FuelTime (RACES)
;
; • (Re)spawns only have limited fuel at Heat levels for which you define valid time values.
; • Rejoining recycles whatever fuel the helicopter had when it last despawned instead.
; • Each fuel amount is a random value between "minFuelTime" and "maxFuelTime".
; • (Re)spawns at Heat levels without time values have unlimited fuel.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.
