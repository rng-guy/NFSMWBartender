; This file defines the helicopter's spawning behaviour in pursuits.
;
; The helicopter will only spawn at Heat levels for which you specify 
; timer values in the [Helicopter:Timers] section below. If you do not 
; want the helicopter to spawn at some Heat level, simply remove the 
; Heat level in question from that section of this file.
;
; "default" values (where permitted) apply to all Heat levels not
; listed in their respective sections. Use them to declutter this
; file should you wish to set the same value(s) to multiple levels.


[Helicopter:Vehicle]
; Which vehicle spawns as the helicopter (if enabled).
; Format: heatXY = heliVehicle
; - Has no bearing on whether a helicopter can spawn (see [Helicopter:Timers]).
; - All vehicles specified here must have the "CHOPPER" class in VltEd.
; - Any vehicles specified here will be ignored in all "Cars.ini" tables.
; - Only one helicopter can ever be active at the same time.
; - You can specify a "default" value here.

[Helicopter:Timers]
; How quickly (in seconds) the helicopter (de / re)spawns.
; Format: heatXY = minSpawnDelay, maxSpawnDelay, ..Despawn.., ..Respawn..
; - The helicopter will only spawn at Heat levels listed here.
; - The helicopter will also spawn in Cooldown mode if listed here.
; - "Spawn" values are used to time the first spawn only.
; - "Despawn" values are used to time all despawns.
; - "Respawn" values are used to time all spawns after the first.
; - The helicopter will still despawn properly after Heat transitions.
; - The helicopter will use the AirSupportStrategy set in VltEd.
; - You cannot specify a "default" value tuple here.
