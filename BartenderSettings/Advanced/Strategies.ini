; This file defines the respawning and (un)blocking behaviour of Heavy / LeaderStrategy requests.

; For the TECHNICAL DETAILS AND LIMITATIONS of the features in here, see the "APPENDIX.txt" file.
; The UNEDITED VALUES in this file approximate the game's vanilla (i.e. unmodified) values.

[Heavy3:Fleeing]
; Below what player speed (in kph) HeavyStrategy 3 spawns cancel their ramming attempts and flee.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = playerSpeedThreshold (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = playerSpeedThreshold (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • The vanilla game uses the "CollapseSpeed" VltEd parameter for this purpose instead.
; • Higher thresholds make HeavyStrategy 3 spawns more likely to flee before they reach you.
; • A threshold of 0 prevents HeavyStrategy 3 spawns from cancelling their ramming attempts.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value.

[Leader:CrossAggro]
; Delay interval (in seconds) for when LeaderStrategy Cross becomes aggressive.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)AggroDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)AggroDelay (RACES)
;
; • The vanilla game forces LeaderStrategy Cross to be passive until his Strategy ends.
; • Cross will only turn aggressive at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • The aggression delay is a random number between "minAggroDelay" and "maxAggroDelay".
; • Delays longer than the LeaderStrategy's "Duration" VltEd parameter have no effect.
; • Once aggressive, LeaderStrategy Cross stays aggressive until he despawns.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)AggroDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)AggroDelay (RACES)
;
; • All usage comments for "[Leader:CrossAggro]" apply here as well, but for henchmen.

;
; • The vanilla game resets Cross' spawn flag instantly if his LeaderStrategy expires.
; • Once Cross' spawn flag is reset, the game can attempt LeaderStrategy requests again.
; • This spawn-flag reset only happens at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • Each spawn-flag reset delay is a random number between "minResetDelay" and "maxResetDelay".
; • Without unblocking (see "[Leader7:Unblocking]" below), all henchmen must also despawn first.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

; ── ■ │ REQUEST UNBLOCKING │ ■ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)UnblockDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)UnblockDelay (RACES)
;
; • The vanilla game can only request a new Strategy once a given LeaderStrategy 5 has ended.
; • Bartender can unblock the request queue earlier, allowing for multiple Strategy spawns.
; • The unblocking only happens at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • Each unblock delay is a random number between "minUnblockDelay" and "maxUnblockDelay".
; • Delays longer than the LeaderStrategy 5 "Duration" VltEd parameter have no effect.
; • When Bartender unblocks the queue, the LeaderStrategy 5 continues for its full "Duration".
; • It is safe to set both delays to 0, making LeaderStrategy 5 a completely "free" Strategy.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)UnblockDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)UnblockDelay (RACES)
;
; • All usage comments for "[Leader5:Unblocking]" apply here as well, but for HeavyStrategy 3.
; • But: Short delays can cause game instability, as HeavyStrategy 3 spawns ignore spawn limits.
; • But: It's often better to just use lower (~20 seconds) "Duration" VltEd parameters instead.
