; ── ■ │ HEAVYSTRATEGY 3 BEHAVIOUR │ ■ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Heavy3:Cancellation]
; Below what racer speed (in kph) HeavyStrategy 3 vehicles cancel their ramming attempts and flee.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = racerSpeedThreshold (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = racerSpeedThreshold (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • The vanilla game uses the "CollapseSpeed" VltEd parameter for this purpose instead.
; • Higher thresholds make HeavyStrategy 3 vehicles likely to flee before they reach their target.
; • Defining a low threshold fixes the vanilla issue of HeavyStrategy 3 vehicles becoming passive.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value.

default = 25.0

heat01 = 25.0
heat02 = 25.0
heat03 = 25.0
heat04 = 25.0
heat05 = 25.0
heat06 = 25.0

[Heavy3:Count]
; How many vehicles can spawn through each successful HeavyStrategy 3 request.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}SpawnsPerRequest (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = {min, max}SpawnsPerRequest (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • Each count is a random number between "maxSpawnsPerRequest" and "maxSpawnsPerRequest".
; • For spawn counts > 2 per request, you may also need the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • See the "README.txt" file for how to configure the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • Each value must be a whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value pair.

default = 2, 2

heat01 = 2, 2
heat02 = 2, 2
heat03 = 2, 2
heat04 = 2, 2
heat05 = 2, 2

[Heavy3:Joining]
; Whether HeavyStrategy 3 vehicles can join the pursuit once their request expires.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = joinsPursuit (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = joinsPursuit (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • For joining from HeavyStrategy 3, you may also need the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • See the "README.txt" file for how to configure the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • Vehicles of cancelled HeavyStrategy 3 requests are also affected by joining.
; • To limit how many vehicles can join this way, see "[Joining:Limit]" below.
; • Each value must be either "true" or "false".
; • You can define a "default" value.

default = false

heat01 = false
heat02 = false
heat03 = false
heat04 = false
heat05 = false

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = totalJoinLimit (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = totalJoinLimit (RACES)
;
; • Joining of this kind is limited only at Heat levels for which you define valid limit values.
; • To enable joining from expired HeavyStrategy 3 requests, see "[Heavy3:Joining]" above.
; • Each value must be a whole number.
; • You can't' define a "default" value.

;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = {min, max}AggroDelay (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = {min, max}AggroDelay (RACES)
;
; • The vanilla game forces LeaderStrategy 5 Cross to be passive until his Strategy expires.
; • Cross will turn aggressive only at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • The aggression delay is a random number between "minAggroDelay" and "maxAggroDelay".
; • Delays longer than the LeaderStrategy 5's "Duration" VltEd parameter have no effect.
; • Once aggressive, LeaderStrategy 5 Cross stays aggressive until he despawns.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

;
; • The vanilla game resets Cross' spawn flag instantly if his LeaderStrategy 5 expires.
; • Once Cross' spawn flag is reset, the game can attempt LeaderStrategy requests again.
; • This spawn-flag reset happens only at Heat levels for which you define valid delay values.
; • Each spawn-flag reset delay is a random number between "minResetDelay" and "maxResetDelay".
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.

; • Bartender can unblock the request queue earlier, allowing for multiple Strategy requests.
; • Unblocking happens after some delay following each successful LeaderStrategy 5 spawn.

; • Each unblock delay is a random number between "minUnblockDelay" and "maxUnblockDelay".
; • Delays longer than the LeaderStrategy 5 "Duration" VltEd parameter have no effect.
