[Leader:EscapeReset]
; After how long (in seconds) the game can request another LeaderStrategy if Cross loses you.

; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minResetDelay, maxResetDelay (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minResetDelay, maxResetDelay (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • The vanilla game resets Cross' LeaderStrategy spawn flag without any delay if he loses you.
; • Bartender's "Advanced" feature set disables this vanilla flag-resetting behaviour by default.
; • This spawn-flag reset only happens at Heat levels for which you provide valid delay values.
; • The spawn-flag reset delay is a random number between "minResetDelay" and "maxResetDelay".
; • Without unblocking (see next section), LeaderStrategy 7 henchmen must also despawn first.
; • All values must be decimals or whole numbers.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.

; ── ■ │ STRATEGY-SPAWN UNBLOCKING │ ■ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Leader5:Unblock]
; How early (in seconds) the game can request another Strategy after a LeaderStrategy 5 spawn.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minUnblockDelay, maxUnblockDelay (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minUnblockDelay, maxUnblockDelay (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • The vanilla game can only request a new Strategy once a given LeaderStrategy 5 has ended.
; • Bartender can unblock the request queue before the end, allowing more Strategy requests.
; • The unblock only happens at Heat levels for which you provide valid delay values.
; • The unblock delay is a random number between "minUnblockDelay" and "maxUnblockDelay".
; • Delays longer than the "Duration" VltEd parameter of LeaderStrategy 5 effectively do nothing.
; • When Bartender unblocks the queue, the LeaderStrategy 5 continues for its full duration.
; • When Bartender unblocks the queue, LeaderStrategy 5 vehicles start behaving like regular cops.
; • It is safe to set both delays to 0, making LeaderStrategy 5 a completely "free" Strategy.
; • All values must be decimals or whole numbers.
; • You can't define a "default" value pair.
