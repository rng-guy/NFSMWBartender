; This file defines which ground vehicles may (de / re)spawn in pursuits, and how.
;
; For the TECHNICAL DETAILS AND LIMITATIONS of the features in here, see the "APPENDIX.txt" file.
; The UNEDITED VALUES in this file resemble the game's vanilla (i.e. unmodified) values.






; ── ■ │ PURSUIT BOARD │ ■ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Board:Tracking]
; Which non-"Chasers" are also tracked by the engagement count shown above the pursuit board.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heavyStrategyVehicles   = areTracked
;           leaderStrategyVehicles  = areTracked
;           joinedRoadblockVehicles = areTracked
;
; • Tracked non-"Chasers" cause the engagement count to increment / decrement as they (de)spawn.
; • This is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect backup triggers or any other pursuit mechanics.
; • Tracking HeavyStrategy vehicles can warn you of their arrival if you watch the count.

heavyStrategyVehicles   = false
leaderStrategyVehicles  = false
joinedRoadblockVehicles = false






; ── ■ │ "CHASERS" (DE)SPAWNING │ ■ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Chasers:Limits]
; How many "Chasers" may (re)spawn regardless of engagement count, and the global cop-spawn limit.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minSpawnCount, globalCopSpawnLimit (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minSpawnCount, globalCopSpawnLimit (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • The global cop-spawn limit defines the cop threshold where no more "Chasers" may spawn.
; • The game compares the global cop-spawn limit against the total number of cops in the world.
; • The global cop-spawn limit takes precedence over all other "Chasers"-related spawn limits.
; • For global cop-spawn limits > 8, you may also need the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • See the "README.txt" file for how to configure the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • Each value must be a whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value pair.

default = 1, 8

heat01 = 1, 8
heat02 = 1, 8
heat03 = 1, 8
heat04 = 1, 8
heat05 = 1, 8
heat06 = 1, 8
heat07 = 1, 8
heat08 = 1, 8
heat09 = 1, 8
heat10 = 1, 8

race01 = 1, 8
race02 = 1, 8
race03 = 1, 8
race04 = 1, 8
race05 = 1, 8
race06 = 1, 8
race07 = 1, 8
race08 = 1, 8
race09 = 1, 8
race10 = 1, 8




[Chasers:Independence]
; Whether "Chasers" spawns are independent of non-"Chasers" and cops of other pursuits.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = spawnsAreIndependent (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = spawnsAreIndependent (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • If independent, the global cop-spawn limit applies to each pursuit separately instead.
; • If independent, the global cop-spawn limit disregards all non-"Chasers" in the world.
; • For independent "Chasers" spawns, you may also need the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • See the "README.txt" file for how to configure the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod.
; • Each value must be either "true" or "false".
; • You can define a "default" value.

default = false

heat01 = false
heat02 = false
heat03 = false
heat04 = false
heat05 = false
heat06 = false
heat07 = false
heat08 = false
heat09 = false
heat10 = false

race01 = false
race02 = false
race03 = false
race04 = false
race05 = false
race06 = false
race07 = false
race08 = false
race09 = false
race10 = false




[Chasers:Clearance]
; How far away (in metres) new "Chasers" must spawn from all already active cops.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minSpawnClearance (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minSpawnClearance (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • "Chasers" spawns can fail if the required clearance is large and there are many active cops.
; • Lower values make "Chasers" spawns at Heat levels with 20+ cops much more consistent.
; • Each value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value.

default = 40.0

heat01 = 40.0
heat02 = 40.0
heat03 = 40.0
heat04 = 40.0
heat05 = 40.0
heat06 = 40.0
heat07 = 40.0

race05 = 40.0
race06 = 40.0
race07 = 40.0
race08 = 40.0
race09 = 40.0
race10 = 40.0




[Chasers:Fleeing]
; Delay interval (in seconds) and count threshold for "Chasers" of other Heat levels to flee.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)FleeDelay, chasersThreshold (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)FleeDelay, chasersThreshold (RACES)
;
; • "Chasers" only flee at Heat levels for which you define valid delay and threshold values.
; • "Chasers" only flee while the number of active "Chasers" is above the threshold.
; • "Chasers" only flee if they aren't in the current Heat level's "Chasers" table.
; • Flee delays are random numbers between "minFleeDelay" and "maxFleeDelay".
; • Each delay value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • Each threshold value must be a whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value tuple.

heat01 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat02 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat03 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat04 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat05 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat06 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat07 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat08 = 5.0, 20.0, 2

race07 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
race08 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
race09 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
race10 = 5.0, 20.0, 2






; ── ■ │ CAR SPAWN TABLES │ ■ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;
; The USAGE COMMENTS for Heat level 1 below apply to all 10 Heat levels in the game;
; just replace all mentions of "Heat01" with "HeatXY", where "XY" is the Heat level.
;
; The "chance" values used in spawn tables are weights (like in VltEd), not percentages. The actual
; spawn chance of a vehicle is its "chance" value divided by the sum of the "chance" values of all
; vehicles in the same spawn table. Whenever a vehicle reaches its "count" value (i.e. spawn cap),
; Bartender treats its "chance" value as 0 until there is room for further spawns again.
