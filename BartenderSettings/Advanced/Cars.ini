; ── ■ │ (DE)SPAWNING │ ■ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Chasers:Limits]
; The minimum engagement count and the global cop-spawn limit.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minEngagementCount, globalCopLimit (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minEngagementCount, globalCopLimit (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • A minimum engagement count > 0 allows that many "Chasers" to (re)spawn without backup.
; • The global cop-spawn limit determines how many "Chasers" can be active at any given time.
; • For global cop-spawn limits > 8, you need the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod (see "APPENDIX.txt").
; • Each value must be a whole number.
; • You can define a "default" value pair.

default = 1, 8

heat01 = 1, 8

[Chasers:Independence]
; Whether "Chasers" spawns are independent of non-"Chasers", wrecks, and cops in other pursuits.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = spawnsAreIndependent (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = spawnsAreIndependent (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • Pursuits can block new "Chasers" spawns if too many other vehicles are present.
; • Bartender can make spawning decisions for "Chasers" independent of all other vehicles.
; • Independent "Chasers" spawns require the "NFSMW LimitAdjuster" mod (see "APPENDIX.txt").
; • Each value must be either "true" or "false".
; • You can define a "default" value.

default = false

heat01 = false
heat02 = false

[Chasers:Fleeing]
; Delay interval (in seconds) and count threshold for "Chasers" of other Heat levels to flee.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = (min, max)FleeDelay, chasersThreshold (FREE-ROAM)
;           raceXY = (min, max)FleeDelay, chasersThreshold (RACES)
;
; • Bartender flags "Chasers" to flee if they aren't in the current Heat level's "Chasers" table.
; • "Chasers" only flee at Heat levels for which you define valid delay and threshold values.
; • "Chasers" only flee while the number of active "Chasers" is above the threshold.
; • Flee delays are random numbers between "minFleeDelay" and "maxFleeDelay".
; • Each delay value must be a decimal or whole number.
; • Each threshold value must be a whole number.
; • You can't define a "default" value tuple.

heat01 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat02 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
heat03 = 5.0, 20.0, 2
