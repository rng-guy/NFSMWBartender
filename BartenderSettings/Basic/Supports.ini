; This file defines parameters pertaining to roadblock and Strategy spawns.
;
; If a parameter group (denoted by "[]") permits the use of a "default" value:
;  • Any missing FREE-ROAM Heat levels (denoted "heatXY") will be set to this "default" value.
;  • If you do not specify the "default" value, the game's vanilla value is used for it instead.
;  • Any missing RACING Heat levels (denoted "raceXY") will be set to their FREE-ROAM counterparts.

; Cooldown parameters (in seconds) for regular roadblock spawns.

; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minCooldown, maxCooldown, heavyCooldown (FREE-ROAM; set to default if missing)
;           raceXY = minCooldown, maxCooldown, heavyCooldown (RACES;     set to heatXY  if missing)
;
; • Whenever this cooldown is active, regular roadblocks cannot spawn.
; • Whenever this cooldown is inactive, roadblocks can spawn as defined in VltEd.
; • This cooldown is a random number between "minCooldown" and "maxCooldown".
; • This cooldown is reset whenever a regular roadblock or any Strategy spawns.
; • HeavyStrategy spawns (re)set this cooldown to "heavyCooldown" instead.
; • This cooldown by itself does not affect Heavy / LeaderStrategy spawns in any way.
; • You can specify a "default" value tuple here.

; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = cooldown, maxOverdueDelay (FREE-ROAM; set to default if missing)
;           raceXY = cooldown, maxOverdueDelay (RACES;     set to heatXY  if missing)
;
; • Whenever this cooldown is active, no Heavy / LeaderStrategy can spawn.
; • Whenever this cooldown is inactive, Strategies can spawn as defined in VltEd.
; • Whenever this cooldown has been inactive for the overdue delay, all spawn requests are reset.
; • This cooldown is reset whenever a regular roadblock or Strategy spawns.
; • This cooldown by itself does not affect regular roadblock spawns in any way.
; • The overdue delay fixes the bug of regular roadblock and Strategy spawns slowing down.
; • Specifying short cooldowns / overdue delays may lead to excessive Strategy spam.
; • You can specify a "default" value pair here.
