[Roadblocks:Timers]
; Cooldown parameters (in seconds) for regular roadblock spawns.
;
; ■ FORMAT: heatXY = minCooldown, maxCooldown, heavyCooldown (FREE-ROAM; -> "default" if omitted)
;           raceXY = minCooldown, maxCooldown, heavyCooldown (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • Whenever this cooldown is active, regular roadblocks cannot spawn.
; • Whenever this cooldown is inactive, roadblocks can spawn as defined in VltEd.
; • This cooldown is a random number between "minCooldown" and "maxCooldown".
; • The game resets this cooldown whenever a regular roadblock or Heavy / LeaderStrategy spawns.
; • HeavyStrategy spawns (re)set this cooldown to "heavyCooldown" instead of a random value.
; • This cooldown does not affect Heavy / LeaderStrategy spawns themselves.
; • All values you provide here must be decimals or whole numbers.
; • You can provide a "default" value tuple here.

;           raceXY = cooldown, maxOverdueDelay (RACES;     -> "heatXY"  if omitted)
;
; • Whenever this cooldown is active, no Heavy / LeaderStrategy can spawn.
; • Whenever this cooldown is inactive, any Heavy / LeaderStrategy can spawn as defined in VltEd.
; • This cooldown is reset whenever a regular roadblock or Strategy spawns.
; • This cooldown does not affect regular roadblock spawns themselves.
; • The overdue delay fixes the slowing of regular roadblock and Heavy / Leaderstrategy spawns.
; • Whenever the cooldown has been inactive for the overdue delay, Bartender resets pending spawns.
; • Excessive Leader / HeavyStrategy spam can occur if you use very short cooldowns / delays.
; • All values you provide here must be decimals or whole numbers.
; • You can provide a "default" value pair here.
